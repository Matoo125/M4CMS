COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES:
1. [m4mvc](https://github.com/Matoo125/M4Admin) (M4MVC Framework)
2. [Image intervention](http://image.intervention.io/) (Image Manipulation)


Whole application was rewritten again, this time from VueJS to twig templates.I made page lodating in administration asynchronic, so UX is not worse, than in Vue. The biggest advantage is, that now it will be much easier to create plugins. 

I hope to finish plugin system in September and publish beta version till the end of year, easily usable, extendable and themeable.
