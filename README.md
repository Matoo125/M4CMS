COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES:
1. [m4mvc](https://github.com/Matoo125/M4Admin) (M4MVC Framework)
2. [Image intervention](http://image.intervention.io/) (Image Manipulation)


Administration is using VueJS, so to run in on localhost, you need to have nodejs with npm installed, then go to admin folder and `npm install` and `npm run dev`


I will probably rewrite administration, so it can be independent of build process, because it't hard to work with extensions this way.
